# Stats

This repository is collection of scripts for generating project statistics and
data.

Stats generated by these scripts have been, are and will be used in curl
related blog posts and presentations and by providing the scripts in a public
repository everyone can reproduce the results and can verify the correctness
of them.

And it allows everyone to help out to improve the script and to provide new
ones that generate even more, better and more interesting project stats.

## How to run the scripts

### Check out the main curl git repository

    git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git

    cd curl
    git clone https://github.com/curl/stats.git

## Output

release versions included in each line.
